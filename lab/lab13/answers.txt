2) n is 1000

3) ijk.c performs matrix multiplication in the same manner as in the doc

4) program | loads | stores
   --------+-------+-------
    ijk.c  |  2    | 0
    jki.c  |  2    | 1
    kij.c  |  2    | 1

5) kij.c has the best spatial locality because it accesses all of the
   elements in each row, row by row, which is how C stores array elements,
   so they will be close together in memory.

   jki.c has the worst spatial locality because it accesses all of the
   elements in a column, column by column, which is the opposite of the way
   that C stores array elements so they won't be close together in memory.

6) ijk runs in 0.88 seconds
   jki runs in 2.20 seconds
   kij runs in 0.55 seconds

7) spatial locality matters more, because despite kij performing more
   loads and stores than the other two, it is still the fastest
