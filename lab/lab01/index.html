		<h1>CpSc 2311 Lab 1: Accumulator Machine</h1>
	</div>
	<hr />

	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>The accumulator machine is a simple model of a CPU. In today's lab you will
	experiment with an accumulator simulator so that you can better understand how it
	functions.</p>

	<p>The two most important registers in this type of CPU are the Accumulator
	(<tt>ACC</tt>) and the Program Counter (<tt>PC</tt>). The Accumulator contains the
	current value during computation and the Program Counter keeps track of the current
	instruction (or line) in the program.</p><!-- <p>
  Running the ACC machine simulator prints the value of the program counter, the
  instruction, and the value of the accumulator after each instruction.
</p> -->

	<p>Before looking at the program you will be working on in assembly, here it is
	expressed using C-syntax</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>
	sum = 0;
	for (i = 10; i > 0; i--)
	{
	   sum = sum + i;
	}
		</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<p>To execute it using the accumulator simulator it must be expressed in assembly
	language. Below is the code for it written in generic assembly (this is not ARM
	code).</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>
	            comment(`  set aside memory and initialize variables ')
	word(sum,0)  
	word(i,0)
	word(zero,0)
	word(one,1)
	word(ten,10)

label(start)

	            comment(`  Note: in the rest of the program usually  ')
	            comment(`  more than one assembly code instruction   ')
	            comment(`  is needed for each Java statement         ')
	            comment(`  sum = 0                                   ')

	load(zero)  comment(`  ACC &lt;- memory[zero]  load ACC with zero   ')
	store(sum)  comment(`  memory[sum] &lt;- ACC   store ACC to sum     ')

	            comment(`  i = 10                                    ')
	load(ten)   comment(`  ACC &lt;- memory[ten]                        ')
	store(i)    comment(`  memory[i] &lt;- ACC                          ')

label(loop)

	            comment(`  sum = sum + i                             ')
	load(sum)   comment(`  ACC &lt;- memory[sum]                        ')
	add(i)      comment(`  ACC &lt;- ACC + memory[i]                    ')
	store(sum)  comment(`  memory[sum] &lt;- ACC                        ')

	            comment(`  i = i - 1                                 ')
	load(i)     comment(`  ACC &lt;- memory[i]                          ')
	sub(one)    comment(`  ACC &lt;- ACC - memory[one]                  ')
	store(i)    comment(`  memory[i] <- ACC                          ')

	            comment(`  Conditionally branch back to loop         ')
	bgt0(loop)  comment(`  if ACC > 0 goto loop                      ')

label(done)

	print(sum)  comment(`  Print the value of sum                    ')
	halt        comment(`  Stop the program                          ')

	            comment(`  start execution at label start            ')
	start       comment(`  The last word in the program indicates    ')
	            comment(`  where the program starts                  ')

	<h2>Getting the Lab Files</h2>

	<p>It is highly recommended that you create a seperate folder for this class (ex:
	"~/231lab/lab1") to keep it seperate from the lecture. Open a terminal and navigate to
	the directory you wish to copy the lab files to and run the following command.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>
	cp "/group/course/cpsc231/public_html/lab231/labs/lab01/"* . 2&gt; /dev/null
	
		</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>How to Compile and Run Programs on the Accumulator Machine</h2>

	<p>The shell script <tt>assemble.sh</tt> (which you downloaded in the previous
	section) will translate a program in accumulator assembly language to a numeric form
	that the simulator can read. The shell script accepts the name of your source file as
	a command line argument and produces the assembled code in a file named
	<tt>executable</tt>.</p>

	<p>Note: The last number in the file executable needs to be the address of the first
	executable instruction.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Use the <tt>label</tt> pseudo-instruction to indicate where the program
		begins.</li>

		<li>The last (non-blank) line needs to contain that label.</li>
	</ul>

	<hr />

	<h2>Starting the Simulator</h2>

	<p>To start the simulator, run <tt>./acc</tt> from the command prompt. The program
	will segfault if you do not have a file named "executable" in your directory since
	that is its input file. Once started, the simulator will print each line of the
	original source code along with the program counter value for that line and the
	current value of the accumulator register.</p>

	<p>After the simulator finishes running through the code, it will display basic
	runtime statistics like below:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>
	instructions executed =  90
	instruction fetches   = 189
	data reads            =  50
	data writes           =  22
		</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<p>You will need to record certain statistics as part of the lab</p>

	<hr />

	simulator supports.</p>

	<h2>Three Different Ways to Write a Program</h2>

	<p>The source files <tt>source1.m</tt> and <tt>source2.m</tt> are two different
	methods of computing the sum of the integers between 1 and 10. Both of the programs
	start an index variable at ten and decrement it to zero.</p>

	<p>As part of your assignment, write a third program <tt>my_loop.m</tt> that does the
	same calculation, but starts at one and is incremented to ten. Please have it print the sum at the end of the program like source1.m and source2.m.</p>

	<p>For example, using C-syntax, the code for source1.m and source2.m would look like
	this</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>
	sum = 0;
	for (i = 10; i > 0; i--)
	{
	   sum = sum + i;
	}
		</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<p>while the program you will be writing would look like this</p>

	<blockquote>
		<pre>
	sum = 0;
	for(i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
	{
	   sum = sum + i;
	}
		</pre>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>An Exercise: From Assembly Code to Numbers and Back</h2>

	<p>In the files you copied in the beginning of lab, you should have a file named
	worksheet_a.txt and worksheet_b.txt. Each of these worksheets must be filled in and
	submitted along with your completed source file from the previous section. Worksheet_a
	has 6 questions while worksheet_b is a fill in the blank exercise. Worksheet_b
	actually has the assembly code to 3 programs with the first example completed. You can
	use that example to help you determine how to fill in the blanks for the 2nd and 3rd
	programs.</p>

	<p>Go to handin.cs.clemson.edu in a web browser to submit the following components of your lab:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>my_loop.m</li>

		<li>worksheet_a.txt</li>

		<li>worksheet_b.txt</li>
	</ul>
